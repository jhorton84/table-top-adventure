      "description": "At the southern border of Rokugan stands a grim miracle: the Kaiu Wall, stretching like a great puckered scar along the landscape, its slate-gray blocks fitted together seamlessly into a structure thirty feet thick and a hundred feet tall. To the south loom the blighted Shadowlands, the domain of the corrupted armies of Jigoku, and to the north lie the lands of the Crab Clan, the Wall's crafters and defenders. The Crab Clan are known as guardians and warriors - slayers of monsters and protectors of the realm. Even those who do not fight with weapons often wage war with their minds and words, securing key supplies for their clan, maintaining alliances to guarantee support of the Wall, or engineering new technologies to turn back the endless hordes of the Shadowlands. However, the Crab Clan's task often weighs heavily upon the disciples of the Kami Hida. They are known as taciturn, battle weary, or even disillusioned. The glories of the battlefield are scant reward, and surviving to fight anotherr day can seem its own punishment at times when facing such a relentless threat. Still, these people find ways to live and express themselves, and many revel in the small joys that life provides them.",
      "bushidoTenet": "Courage is the greatest virtue in Crab lands, for the Kami Hida placed an especially grave task on the shoulders of his descendants. The Crab safeguard the most perilous border of the Emerald Empire, warding it against the terrible hordes of Fu Leng. The consequences of failure are obvious and dreadful to contemplate. Rough and warlike, the Crab have never truly adopted the strict social refinement the other clans have come to demand of their constituents, and so Courtesy is defined somewhat more loosely for the Crab.",

The Kami Doji - sister of Hantei, first Emperor - resolved to bring order to this savage realm. The embodiment of elegance and grace, Doji walked among the earthly peoples, calming them in the way fair wather calms a storm-tossed sea. Any Crane will gladly speak of how from her, humans learned writing so they could record their achievements, politics to govern their affairs, economics and commerce to manage their wealth, and art and culture to lift them from their lives of misery. Those she touched the most became her devoted followers, the first samurai of the Crane Clan. Since that time, the Crane have become both the poets and the poetry of the Empire, at once the swordsmiths and the duelists wielding the smiths' blades. In every aspect of their lives, the Crane strive for mastery in all things, an ideal that the other clans can only hope to emulate. The Crane Clan represents the pinnacle of refinement in Rokugan, and its members are known for their elegance, grace, and mastery of social customs. The Crane have become both the poets and the poetry of the Empire, at once the swordsmiths and the duelists wielding the smiths' blades.

Inspired by their mysterious founder, the Kami Togashi, the Dragon place more emphasis than most of their fellow samurai on the individual search for Enlightenment and expertinse. In the centuries since the Kami fell to earth, Togashi's followers have acquired a reputation for strange behavior. Isolated by the mountains of their northern home and entrusted with watching over the Empire, the Dragon rarely participate as actively in tthe politics of the Empire as other clans do - an when they do intervene, it is often for reasons other clans can only guess at. The secret of the Dragon is that they are guided by their founder's foresight, but even they do not always know what Togashi saw in his visions. Togashi's acolytes are known for their esoteric practices, innate curiosity, and veritable tradition of disregarding tradition - at least in the eyes of the other clans. People expect them to be insightful and humble, but also unpredictable, individualistic, and even dangerous. They tend to look at problems from unexpected angles, and they seek solutions others might not consider.",
      "bushidoTenet": "Sincerity - aligning one's words and deeds with one's intentions - is the greatest virtue to the Dragon Clan. In this way, its samurai may remain true to themselves even if they should fail. While members of the Dragon Clan take their obligations seriously, they define Duty and Loyalty somewhat differently than most other samurai. To a Dragon, unquestioning loyalty is not loyalty at all, and Dragon Clan lords have been known to tolerate and even value criticism that others would see as grave insubordination.",

The Lion's military is unrivaled, as there are no sharper tacticians and no larger armies in all of Rokugan. This proud military heritage has earned the Lion Clan a place as the Right Hand of the Emperor, sworn to protect him by serving as his personal guard and his standing army. In light of this duty, fear means nothing to Lion samurai. The threat of death only serves to embolden them and bolster their courage, for there can be no greater end than to perish in honorable combat. As veterans of countless wars, the Lion know that those who attack first shall be victorious. Above all, the Lion live, breathe, and die for the Emperor and Rokugan. Perhaps the most well-known battlefield warriors in the Emerald Empire, the samurai of the LIon Clan are famous for there ferocity, loyalty, and courage. People expect members of the Lion Clan to be warlike and aggressive, often forgetting that the Kami Akodo was a master tactician as well, more than capable of learning from past mistakes and adapting new stratagems on the battlefield.",

These entwined virtues illuminate the path of Rokugan's most mystical Great Clan, the keepers of Tao of Shinsei and caretakers of the Empire's soul. As the scent of incense wafts unseen to all corners of a shrrine, so do the Spirit Realms overlap invisibly with the Realm of Mortals. The Phoenix mediate between the worlds, appealing to the very soul of the lands. Mountains collapse at their whispered requrest, dry rivers are convinced to flow again, plagues are banished, restless ghosts are returned to slumber, and crops flourish in previously barren wastelands. Nevertheless, the Phoenix understand that even the purest wish can have unintended and destructive consequences if the elements are brough out of balance. Although others consider the Phoenix too hesitant in their entreaties to the kami, few are foolhardy enough to test the Phoenix's dedication to peace and harmony. The Kami Shiba and the priest Isawa were very different sorts of leaders. One humble and the other prideful, one calm in his wisdom and the other fierce in his brilliance. As such, people expect members of the Phoenix clan to be calm, thoughtful, and scholarly - but also passionate, and sometimes even arrogant due to the vast knowledge their clan maintains. Both Shiba and Isawa were deeply spiritual; this bond has defined the Phoenix Clan since its earliest days, and people still expect members of the Phoenix Clan to be more concerned with cosmic problems than with matters mundane.",
      "bushidoTenet": "Righteousness drives the samurai of the Phoenix Clan in their pursuits, and they are willing to sacrifice themselves to ensure the right thing is done. They know tthat when samurai do not govern their lands justly, the Heavens themselves will voice their displeasure. At the same time, some truths must not be revealed to the world, and some mysteries are not meant even for the other samurai clans.

Enemies loomed beyond Rokugan's borders, but they also lurked within them. Bayushi swore to protect the Empire by any means necessary. Where the Code of Bushido tied the Emperor's Left and Right Hands - the courtier of the Crand and the mighty legions of the Lion - the Emperor's Underhand could still reach. To combat the liars, the thieves, and the traitors within the Great Clans, Bayushi's followers wouuld have to lie, steal, and cheat in turn. The weapons of the Scorpion became blackmail, poison, and sabotage. The Scorpion dirtied their hands so that others' could remain pure. Yet, in spite of - and perhaps because of - the clan's fearsome reputation, there is none ore loyal than a Scorpion. In a clan of deceivers and manipulators, trust is a hard-earned treasure to be cherished and guarded. Betrayal is punished with swift retribution, the souls of the treacherous forever bound into the horrific limbo of the place known as Traitor's Grove. Such fierce loyalty is a small consolation, at least, given the dangerous but vital role the Scorpion have played in the Empire from the moment their Kami spoke his fateful words: \"I will be your villian, Hantei.\" Bayushi's successors are known for their insidious skill at scheming, but also the potential benefits of partnering with them - for without offering the proper incentives to their allies some of the time, they could never maintain their position as the great schemers of the Empire. People expect members of the Scorpion to be equal parts alluring and treacherous - and loyal only to the Emperor.",
      "bushidoTenet": "Duty and Loyalty is the core tenet of the Scorpion Clan. They must be prepared to do - and sacrifice - anything and everything in tthe service of the Empire.

Their journey was arduous, and they found many starnge and powerful threats. In defeating each one, the clan learned, changing its fightiing styles, magical practices, and even philosophy. To survive, it was forced to adapt - and overcome. After eight centuries of wandering, the Clan of the Wind returned to the Empire as the Unicorn Clan. They wear fur, speak foreign tongues, and wield strange weapons. Although they still revere the Kami Shinjo, they have drifted far from the traditions and ways of the Emerald Empire. Shinjo's descendants are known for their skill as riders, skirmishers, and messengers, and many are trained in foreign fighting techniques or schools of philosophy. People expect them to be worldly and gregarious, if perhaps a bit rough around the edges in polite Rokugani society, given that many members of the clan spend much of their lives ranging across the wilds in Unicorn lands and beyond.",
      "bushidoTenet": "Compassion is the most significant tenet of Bushido to tthe Unicorn Clan, for mutual understanding and cooperation was the key to the clan's survival during its long journey across the wider world. On this journey, members of the Unicorn Clan met many people with a wide variety of beliefs, cultures, and values, and they became far more accustomed to coexistence with strange outsiders than are most Great Clan samurai. The Unicorn Clan has had several centuries to acclimate to the Emerald Empire, tto which it has returned, but the customs and culture they adopted during their travels remain a powerful force within the clan. Thtese customs often clash with the Rokugani concepts of Courtesy, and the Unicorn's seeming dismissal of Rokugani politeness is one of the most contentious ways in which Shinjo's clan differs from those of her siblings.",

They fight loudly, use sweeping movements, and wield weapons many Rokugani do not recognize. As a result, few samurai know how to react to the Moto style, let alone defend against it. Other clans consider the Moto to be barbarians, and the horde uses this to their advantage. If the Empire will not make an effort to undersand the Moto's ways, then how can they stand against them?",

All Shinjo Outriders learn the art of reconnaissance and how to get the most out of their horses. No samurai is more mobile than a mounted Shinjo Outrider. Their preferred weapons is the Shinjo horsebow, which they use with great accuracy even while riding at a gallop. Trained to live off the land, the Shinjo Outriders thoroughly learn the terrain of each potential battlefield before having to fight over it.",

The dojo only accepts women who carry the Utaku name, and even then prospective students must meet stringent standards of prowess and honor. THis is the only school in the Empire that teaches the secrets required to tame the powerful Utaku steeds, massive warhorses that refuse all other riders. In battle, graceful, continuous movements mark their style, as does their unnerving serenity. Even when charging into the fray, Battle Maidens often move in utter silence.",
